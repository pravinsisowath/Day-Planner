# Day-Planner


Day Planner App:

1.index.html
Added divs of all the different blocks of time from 9am-5pm, with classes of time-blocks and ids of the corresponding time, as well as a save button following each block.

2.script.js
Utilizing jQuery, created variables of all the respective times with their ids and used moment as the time function. Created a planner function also using moment and used localStorage to store the input schedule and the time with the save button. Using if, else statements, was able to add the past, present, future classes based upon if the current time was greater than, equal to, or anything other than those. 

3.style.css
Applied the past, present, future colors to their respective classes based upon the current time.

Overview:
Beginning this assignment, it was very difficult for me and I had no idea where to start. I had to google moment.js and read into how to use it correctly. Even so, I was still stuck on what to do. I looked up various youtube tutorials and looked at the source code of these tutorials, but they all seemed to be getting to the (mostly)same place differently and some more complicated than others. However, after reviewing and studying a bunch of these codes for days, I was able to finally grind out a more simple, readable code reaching the requirements in a faster way. Overall, I definitely could not have coded this without reading up and looking at other codes, but at the end I came out with a better understanding of using other resources such as moment and the materials learned in class in order to create a working javascript file.
